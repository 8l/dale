@module drt

'drt' is an abbreviation of 'Dale runtime'. The terminology is not
strictly accurate: it only contains those functions added by the
compiler, implicitly, to every program. In turn, the libraries
generated by way of compiling this module are used by the compiler
implicitly where necessary.
